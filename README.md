Introduction

Alien Invasion is a Space Invaders like game. I started on this project by following along with the first project in the second half of "Python Crash Course". 

Summary

In the game Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that moves from side to side along the bottom of the screen. The player can control the movement of the ship with the left and right arrow keys. Bullets are fired from the ship using the spacebar, to defend against the oncoming aliens. The goal of the player is to last as long as possible against the aliens, with the difficulty slowly increasing over time as the player clears each screen of aliens. If an alien ship collides with the player, or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses all three of their ships, the game will end.
